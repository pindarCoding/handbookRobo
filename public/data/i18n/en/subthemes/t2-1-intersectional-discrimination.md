# Intersectional Discrimination & Power Asymmetries

## Introduction

While generational stereotypes are widely discussed (e.g. “Gen Z are digital natives,” “Baby Boomers resist change”), less attention is given to how age combines with other axes of identity to produce unique forms of disadvantage or power imbalance.  
This topic investigates what amplifies generational discrimination, how relational asymmetries show up in practice and how different generations perceive and are affected by them.

Generational diversity in the workplace is often framed in terms of stereotypes – such as Baby Boomers valuing stability or Gen Z demanding flexibility – but when viewed through an intersectional lens, age is only one axis of identity shaping people’s opportunities.  
Intersectional discrimination occurs when multiple identities interact to produce unique experiences of bias that are not adequately captured by considering each identity in isolation.  

For example, an employee who is both older and has a disability may face different barriers than a younger colleague with the same disability.  
Similarly, a young employee from an ethnic minority may experience prejudice differently than their peers.  
Generational identity, in combination with other social markers, shapes not only who is targeted by bias but also who has the power to influence organisational decisions and intervene in discriminatory situations.  

Younger women of colour may experience both age-related stereotypes (e.g., being “inexperienced”) and racialised/gendered biases, which together amplify barriers to recognition and advancement.  
Research on intersectional inequalities confirms that overlapping disadvantages (e.g., age and low income) have cumulative effects on life chances and mental health outcomes.

### Types of Intersectional Factors

**Disability & Mental Illness:**  
Physical or cognitive impairments, as well as mental health conditions, can compound the effects of age-based stereotypes.  
Younger employees with disabilities may struggle with accessibility in digital tools or workplace accommodations, while older employees may face assumptions about their capacity to adapt.  
Mental health concerns intersect with age to influence inclusion, participation and visibility in decision-making processes.

**Ethnicity / Nationality:**  
Employees from ethnic minority backgrounds may experience bias that overlaps with generational stereotypes.  
For instance, a younger ethnic minority employee may be stereotyped as inexperienced and excluded from key projects, while an older colleague from a minority group may face both ageism and racial prejudice, limiting leadership opportunities.

**Gender:**  
Gender norms and expectations interact with generational identity in complex ways.  
Women from younger generations may confront assumptions about ambition or assertiveness.

**Religion:**  
Religious identity can amplify or intersect with age-based expectations, shaping perceptions of cultural fit, work ethic or availability for workplace rituals or events.  
Employees navigating religious practices alongside generational expectations may experience subtle forms of exclusion.

**Socio-Economic Class:**  
Socio-economic background intersects with generational identity in areas such as education, access to professional networks and familiarity with digital tools.  
Younger employees from lower-income backgrounds may be at a disadvantage in workplaces that value costly certifications or digital fluency, while older employees may lack exposure to newer professional networks, compounding the effects of age stereotypes.

**Appearance / Physical Characteristics:**  
Societal expectations about appearance – weight, dress, perceived energy or fitness – can intersect with age to influence perceptions of competence, professionalism or adaptability.  
Older employees may be judged as less energetic, while younger employees may be dismissed as appearing less serious or credible.

Power asymmetries often rest on what is considered “normative” or “standard” in an organisation – seniority, traditional career trajectories, styles of communication, etc.  
Older generations often hold more formal power in terms of roles, seniority, institutional memory, and networks; younger generations may hold social or cultural power in terms of new technologies, fresh thought, and values (e.g. social justice, inclusion) but less structural power.  

When combined with other identity markers (gender, ethnicity, disability, caregiving responsibilities), younger or older workers from marginalised groups can face double or triple disadvantage.

For example, intersectional identity work research (in organisational settings) shows how senior minority ethnic women or men negotiate power asymmetries by using different facets of identity as resources or cues in interactions – sometimes amplifying privilege (e.g. seniority) or mitigating disadvantage (ethnicity, gender) depending on context.

Different generations perceive and experience intersectional discrimination in distinctive ways, reflecting both their positions within organisational hierarchies and the societal context in which they came of age.

**Gen Z:**  
Younger employees often report heightened awareness of multiple overlapping factors that can influence inequity.  
They may be particularly sensitive to how disability and ethnicity intersect with age to affect inclusion, recognition, and access to opportunities.  
Their attention to mental health and social inclusion also reflects a generational norm of valuing personal wellbeing and openness in professional contexts.

**Millennials:**  
Occupying early to mid-career positions, Millennials tend to recognise a broad range of factors that may compound disadvantage.  
Their experiences highlight that even when structural opportunities exist, overlapping social identities – such as disability, mental health, gender, and socio-economic background – can still create subtle barriers to advancement.  
Their narratives emphasise the importance of intersectional awareness in performance evaluations, mentorship and workplace support systems.

**Generation X:**  
Often serving as mid-level leaders or experienced professionals, Gen X employees navigate complex hierarchies.  
They may observe or experience bias related to religion or disability, reflecting how power dynamics influence both the manifestation and visibility of discrimination.  
Gen X insights underscore that intersectional bias is not only about who experiences disadvantage but also about how organisations respond – or fail to respond – through policies and social norms.

**Baby Boomers:**  
Older employees report fewer instances of intersectional discrimination, yet certain factors – particularly disability – remain significant barriers to full participation.  
This suggests that while generational stereotypes may obscure some forms of bias, age combined with other marginalised identities can still limit opportunities and access to resources, making inclusive policy design essential across all cohorts.

### Relational Asymmetries

Intersectional discrimination also involves relational asymmetries, meaning differences in who is expressing bias, who is targeted and who intervenes.  
These relational asymmetries shape workplace culture and the effectiveness of inclusion initiatives.

**Vocalisation:**  
Generational norms influence how bias is expressed or challenged.  
Older cohorts may prioritise harmony and avoid openly calling out discrimination, while younger employees may be more outspoken but face risks such as backlash, social isolation, or reputational harm.

**Targeting:**  
Certain groups consistently face higher rates of discrimination based on combined identities.  
For example, employees who are both younger and from an ethnic minority, or older and living with a disability, may experience amplified exclusion, microaggressions or undervaluation.

**Support and Intervention:**  
Witnesses play a critical role in mitigating bias, but generational identity often affects whether individuals intervene.  
Middle-management employees may act as allies, while peers or those with less authority may feel constrained.  
These asymmetries highlight the importance of cultivating an organisational culture where supporting colleagues is normalised and safe.

Younger generations may be more vocal about unfair treatment but lack the authority to enact change.  
Older generations may hold positional power but adhere to norms that discourage openly challenging bias.  
These asymmetries affect organisational culture, as unaddressed discrimination can lead to alienation, reduced morale, and talent attrition.

At an individual level, the consequences include emotional strain, diminished sense of belonging and impaired career progression.  
Organisations experience lower engagement, increased conflict and the risk of losing diverse talent if intersectional dynamics are ignored.  
Recognising these asymmetries and their consequences is critical for designing interventions that address not just age-based discrimination but the complex ways it intersects with other identities.
