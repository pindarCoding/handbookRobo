Types of Intersectional Factors : 
• Disability & Mental Illness:  Physical or cognitive impairments, as well as mental health 
conditions, can compound the effects of age -based stereotypes. Younger employees 
with disabilities may struggle with accessibility in digital tools or workplace 
accommodations, while older employees may face assumptions about their capacity 
to adapt. Mental health concerns intersect with age to influence inclusion, participation and visibility in decision -making processes.  
• Ethnicity / Nationality:  Employees from ethnic minority backgrounds may experience 
bias that overlaps with generational stereotypes. For instance, a younger ethnic 
minority employee may be stereotyped as inexperienced and excluded from key 
projects, while an older colleague from a minority group may face both ageism and racial prejudice, limiting leadership opportunities.  
• Gender:  Gender norms and expectations interact with generational identity in 
complex ways. Women from younger generations may confront assumptions about 
ambition or assertiveness.  
• Religion:  Religious identity can amplify or intersect with age -based expectations, 
shaping perceptions of cultural fit, work ethic or availability for workplace rituals  
or events. Employees navigating religious practices alongside generational 
expectations may experience subtle forms of exclusion.  
• Socio -Economic Class:  Socio -economic background intersects with generational 
identity in areas such as education, access to professional networks and familiarity 
with digital tools. Younger employees from lower -income backgrounds may  
be at a disadvantage in workplaces that value costly certifications or digital fluency, 
while older employees may lack exposure to newer professional networks, 
compounding the effects of age stereotypes.  
• Appearance / Physical Characteristics:  Societal expectations about appearance  – 
weight, dress, perceived energy or fitness  – can intersect with age to influence 
perceptions of competence, professionalism or adaptability. For example, older 
employees may be judged as less energetic, while younger employees may  
be dismissed as appearing less serious or credible . 
Power asymmetries often rest on what is considered “normative” or “standard” in an 
organis ation – seniority, traditional career trajectories, styles of communication, etc.  
Older generations often hold more formal power in terms of roles, seniority, institutional 
memory, networks; younger generations may hold social or cultural power in terms of new 
technologies, fresh thought, values (e.g. social justice, inclusion) but less  structural power. 
When combined with other identity markers (gender, ethnicity, di sability, caregiving 
responsibilities), younger or older workers from marginalis ed groups can face double  
or triple disadvantage.  
For example, intersectional identity work research (in organi sational settings) shows how 
senior minority ethnic women or men  negotiate power asymmetries by using different facets

of identity as resources or cues in interactions  – sometimes amplifying privilege  
(e.g. seniority) or mitigating disadvantage (ethnicity, gender) depending on context.  
Different generations perceive and experience intersectional discrimination in distinctive 
ways, reflecting both their positions within organi sational hierarchies and the societal context 
in which they came of age. Younger employees, such as Gen Z, often report heightened 
awareness of multiple overlapping factors that can influence inequity. For instance, they  
may be particularly sensitive to how disability and ethnicity intersect with age to affect 
inclusion, recognition, and access to opportunities. Thei r attention to mental health and social 
inclusion also reflects a generational norm of valuing personal wellbeing and openness  
in professional contexts.  
Millennials, occupying early to mid -career positions, tend to recogni se a broad range  
of factors that may compound disadvantage. Their experiences highlight that even when 
structural opportunities exist, overlapping social identities  – such as disability, mental health, 
gender, and socio -economic background  – can still create subtle barriers to advancement. 
Their narratives emphasi se the importance of intersectional awareness in performance 
evaluations, mentorship and workplace support systems.  
Generation X employees often serve as mid -level leaders or experienced professionals, 
navigating complex hierarchies. They may observe or experience bias related to religion  
or disability, reflecting how power dynamics influence both the manifestation and visibility  
of discrimination. Gen X insights underscore that intersectional bias is not only about who experiences disadvantage but also about how organi sations respond  – or fail to respond  – 
through policies and social norms.  
Older employees, such as Baby Boomers, report fewer instances of intersectional discrimination, yet certain factors  – particularly disability – remain significant barriers to full 
participation. This suggests that while generational stereotypes may obscure some forms  
of bias, age combined with other marginalis ed identities can still limit opportunities  
and access to resources, making inclusive policy design essential across all cohorts.  
Intersectional discrimination also involves relational asymmetries, meaning differences in who is expressing bias, who is targeted and who intervenes. These relational asymmetries shape workplace culture and the effectiveness of inclusion initiatives:  
• Vocali sation:  Generational norms influence how bias is expressed or challenged.  
Older cohorts may prioritis e harmony and avoid openly calling out discrimination, 
while younger employees may be more outspoken but face risks such as backlash, 
social isolation, or reputational harm.  
• Targeting:  Certain groups consistently face higher rates of discrimination based  
on combined identities. For example, employees who are both younger and from  
an ethnic minority, or older and living with a disability, may experience amplified 
exclusion, microaggressions or undervaluation.  
• Support and Intervention:  Witnesses play a critical role in mitigating bias,  
but generational identity often affects whether individuals intervene.

Middle -management employees may act as allies, while peers or those with less 
authority may feel constrained. These asymmetries highlight the importance  
of cultivating an organis ational culture where supporting colleagues is normalis ed  
and safe.  
Younger generations may be more vocal about unfair treatment but lack the authority  
to enact change. Older generations may hold positional power but adhere to norms that 
discourage openly challenging bias. These asymmetries affect organis ational culture,  
as unaddressed discrimination can lead to alienation, reduced morale, and talent attrition.  
At an individual level, the consequences include emotional strain, diminished sense  
of belonging and impaired career progression. Organis ations experience lower engagement, 
increased conflict and the risk of losing diverse talent if intersectional dynamics are ignored. Recogni sing these asymmetries and their consequences is critical for designing interventions 
that address not just age -based discrimination but the complex ways it intersects with  
other identities.  
Self-assessment  
Which strategy best addresses intersectional discrimination for all generations?  
a) Only provide training to younger employees.  
b) Focus exclusively on gender diversity initiatives.  
c) Implement mentorship, inclusive policies and training 
that consider multiple intersecting identities.  
d) Encourage employees to solve discrimination issues 
individually without guidance.  Intersectional approaches must 
address multiple identities 
across generations; mentoring, policies and training ensure systemic support.  
Why might Baby Boomers report fewer experiences of intersectional discrimination 
compared to younger generations?  
a) They experience no discrimination.  
b) Their position in hierarchies and cultural norms may 
shield them, though disability remains a key issue.  
c) They are naturally more resilient to discrimination.  
d) Intersectionality does not apply to older employees.  Baby Boomers often hold senior 
roles or benefit from established authority, which can buffer them from certain forms of discrimination, though disability based discrimination still features highly.  
Patterns of Voice, Victimhood and Support  
Introduction  
Discrimination in the workplace cannot be understood through age alone. While generational 
identity shapes who expresses bias, who experiences it and who steps in to provide support, other factors such as gender, ethnicity, disability and socio -economic background intersect  
to create layered patterns of exclusion. Recognis ing these intersections is essential to grasp 
the full complexity of workplace inequalities.

The expression of discriminatory comments in the workplace is a significant concern.  
Data from the MYCo survey reveal that older generations, particularly Baby Boomers  
and Generation X, are more frequently reported to express discriminatory remarks.  
This trend may be attributed to fixed cultural norms and a lack of awareness regarding 
contemporary issues of diversity and inclusion. Conversely, younger generations,  
such as Millennials and Generation Z, report experiencing these comments more frequently, highlighting a potential generational divide in both the perpetration and victimi sation  
of discriminatory behaviours .

The experience of being subjected to discriminatory comments can have profound effects  
on employees. Younger generations, especially Millennials and Generation Z, report higher instances of victimis ation. This increased exposure can lead to feelings of alienation, 
decreased job satisfaction, and heightened stress levels. The intersectionality of age with 
other identity factors, such as gender and ethnicity, further exacerbates these effects,  
leading to compounded disadvantages for certain individuals.

Victimis ation in the workplace often affects younger employees, particularly those in the early 
stages of their careers, such as Millennials and Generation Z. This heightened exposure  
can arise from several interrelated factors. First, hierarchical positioning plays a role: entry - 
and mid -level employees are frequently more vulnerable to critical or exclusionary remarks 
from senior colleagues. Second, cultural mismatches between generat ions – differences  
in communication styles, expectations, or workplace  values – can create friction that 
sometimes manifests as subtle or overt discriminatory behaviour. Finally, age rarely acts 
alone; it intersects with other identity factors, including gender, ethnicity, or disability, amplifying the likelihood of marginali sation. For example, a young woman of colour  may  
face compounded challenges tied to both age and gender, layered further with raciali sed 
assumptions, making her experience of exclusion particularly acute. These patterns illustrate 
that workplace victimis ation is shaped not just by age, but by the complex interplay  
of multiple social identities within organi sational structures.  
Support for colleagues who experience discriminatory comments plays a crucial role  
in shaping whether workplaces feel inclusive and safe. Younger employees, particularly 
Millennials and Gen Z, are often at the forefront of such efforts. Their willingness to step  
in, challenge inappropriate behaviour, and affirm the dignity of others reflects a broader generational shift toward inclusivity and fairness. Yet, while these gestures of solidarity  
are significant, their impact is not always equal. Employees in  junior roles may offer moral 
support, but their ability to alter outcomes is limited when organi sational hierarchies place 
authority in the hands of older, more senior staff. By contrast, when colleagues with formal 
power (often from older generations ) intervene on behalf of victims, their actions can carry 
greater weight, changing norms and signalling that discrimination will not be tolerated.  
This imbalance reveals an important dynamic: while the will to support may be strongest among younger generation s, the ability to effect real change depends heavily on positional 
authority and organi sational structures.

frequently compound the experience of exclusion. Women across generations, for example, 
often face gendered barriers that intersect with age -related stereotypes, producing additional 
hurdles to recognition and advancement. Similarly, employees from minorit y ethnic 
backgrounds may encounter prejudices that intensify when combined with perceptions  
tied to youth or seniority. For those with disabilities, expectations around adaptability  
or productivity can create further disadvantage, especially when layered  onto generational 
assumptions. Even socio -economic status shapes opportunity: access to education,  
resources and networks often interacts with age to determine who is seen as credible  or deserving of advancement.  
Taken together, these intersecting factors reveal that discrimination is not the product  
of a single identity marker but the outcome of multiple, overlapping characteristics that 
create unique patterns of vulnerability. Younger workers tend to report the highest levels  
of victimis ation, reflecting both their positioning within organi sational hierarchies  
and the way age interacts with other marginali sed identities. At the same time, older 
generations are more often associated with the expression of discri minatory behaviours ,  
a pattern that may be linked to long -established cultural norms and the concentration  
of authority in senior roles. Support for victims is most frequently demonstrated by younger 
employees, suggesting a generational shift toward allyship, though their ability to influence outcomes remains constrained by their position in the hierarchy.  
These dynamics make clear that age cannot be analysed  in isolation. It shapes the likelihood 
of expressing, experiencing, or challenging discrimination, but it does so in concert with other 
social factors. Understanding the full picture requires an intersectional perspective  – one that 
recogni ses how gender, ethnicity, disability and socio -economic status interact with 
generational identity to create complex, multi- layered vulnerabilities in the workplace.  
Recogni sing these patterns is essential for interpreting workplace dynamics accurately.  
It emphasi ses that generational diversity brings not only differences in work styles and values 
but also complex interactions with social inequalities. A nuanced understanding of these 
dynamics is crucial for fostering truly inclusive and equitable work environments,  ensuring 
that all employees, regardless of age or other identity factors, are acknowledged, respected 
and supported.

Strategies to Avoid and Tackle Intersectional Differences  
at Work  
Introduction  
Workplaces are not only sites of collaboration but also sites where inequalities can become 
entrenched. When generational diversity intersects with other social categories such  
as gender, ethnicity, disability or socio- economic status, the risk of discrimination increases. 
Tackling these dynamics requires more than acknowledging them: it requires deliberate, structured and sustained strategies. A handbook on inclusion must therefore move beyond describing problems to providing tools for action.
 
Content  
One of the most fundamental strategies for addressing intersectional discrimination  
is awareness raising . Employees often understand the barriers they personally encounter  
but remain less attentive to the challenges affecting others. This selective perception can unintentionally reinforce silos between generations. For example, younger workers, especially 
Gen Z, are highly attuned to issues of ethnicity and disability, refle cting their lived realities  
in increasingly diverse societies. Millennials often bring mental health and stress -related 
concerns to the forefront, emphasi sing how workplace culture and workloads intersect with 
personal wellbeing. Members of Generation X, on the other hand, frequently identify 
exclusion based on religion and disability, shaped by their own mid -career experiences.  
Baby Boomers are generally less likely to perceive broad patterns of intersectional disadvantage, focusing more narrowly on disability. Without structured opportunities  
for dialogue, each group risks treating its own perspective as universal. Awareness sessions, 
storytelling initiatives, and cross -generational workshops can help employees develop  
a shared vocabulary, allowing them to see discrimination as multi- faceted rather  
than confined to their own lens.
