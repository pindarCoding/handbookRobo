# Introduction

The following section deals with different generations and cultures in the workplace and the challenges that can arise in the workplace. 

Generational conflicts have always existed. Since ancient times, there have been reports of older generations complaining about disrespect shown to them by younger generations (Kollewe 2016: 188). However, ethnological research shows that across cultures, age alone does not determine attitudes to respect. Comparisons between different cultures seem to show that respect for older and elderly people is closely linked to their status in society. Due to their life experience, older people often have greater knowledge (factual, historical, magical), more material goods and, as a result, enjoy a better position in the group or society (Kollewe 2016: 189). Strictly speaking, the factor of "age" is therefore only an observable physical characteristic. It is not biological age itself that has a higher social value. Rather, it seems that societies associate certain factors with "age" that have positive connotations and are therefore reason enough to be valued.

## When do value conflicts between generations arise?

We often hear about generational conflicts in the workplace. As in other areas and situations, conflicts between generations often arise when values are not shared. 

A conflict of values between individuals arises when people in a shared situation hold different values, norms or moral principles to be correct, yet these cannot all be achieved at the same time. Since values underpin decisions, actions and judgements, differing orientations are bound to clash. These values are equally valid in themselves, so there is no single objectively right or wrong position. Where a common solution cannot be reached, the unresolved situation may give rise to misunderstandings, tensions or conflicts.

## Observations from the project survey

This was also reflected in the results of the survey conducted by the project partnership. Across all participating countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Portugal), value conflicts were most evident in relation to differences in communication style, approaches to leadership, and attitudes towards time and work. A cross-country comparison suggests that older generations tend to be more hierarchical and rule-oriented – or are at least perceived in this way – and identify more closely with their work. Younger generations, by contrast, seem more flexible, digitally minded and egalitarian, placing greater emphasis on work–life balance. However, this may be viewed by older generations as a sign of unreliability, selfishness or even laziness.

## How can a conflict of values be better understood?

Schulz von Thun’s value and development quadrant can help in understanding value conflicts, both within individuals and between them. The model illustrates how values are balanced both between people and within a person. Each value has a positive counterforce – a ‘countervalue’ – that complements it and prevents it from sliding into extremes. A single value, if not balanced by its countervalue, can become exaggerated or ‘one-sided’. Thus, every value can take on an extreme form, for example: directness versus bluntness, or verbal politeness versus vagueness. Conflicts often emerge when a value is expressed in its negative form, or what Schulz von Thun terms a ‘devaluing exaggeration’, or when it is perceived as such by others.

## How can a value conflict be resolved?

According to Schulz von Thun, the value and development model can be applied both to conflict situations and personal growth. Individuals can become aware of the negative expression of a value and actively move away from it. For example, if someone is too direct or overly domineering, they can consciously work towards its positive counterpart, such as indirectness or tolerance.

The value and development square offers a useful approach that can also be applied to interpreting and resolving generational conflicts. What often stands out negatively in such conflicts – and what generations frequently accuse one another of – is the ‘devalued exaggeration’ of a value. Resolving the conflict would therefore involve moving towards the alternative positive counterpart.

## What happens when not only different generations but also people from different cultures work together?

Nowadays, it has become very common for people from different backgrounds and cultures to work together.

Alexander Thomas describes culture as an orientation system inherent to all people, though expressed in different forms. Culture shapes the field of action of a population and encompasses objects, institutions, ideas and values. It manifests itself in a system of orientation typical of a society or group, incorporating specific symbols such as language, gestures and rituals. This system influences people’s perceptions, thoughts and actions, and is passed on to subsequent generations. In doing so, it creates identity and a sense of belonging (Alexander Thomas, 2005, p. 21).

Cultures therefore embody certain values that are characteristic of their members in a culture-specific way. Intercultural conflicts frequently arise from the differing cultural expressions of these values.

For our purposes, it is useful to consider what challenges arise in the workplace when both ‘generation’ and ‘culture’ are taken into account. Naturally, cultural differences cannot be cited as the cause of every difficulty. Some challenges are independent of culture and stem solely from generational differences. Likewise, the extent to which personality influences difficult situations is independent of both generation and culture, yet remains a decisive factor in how such situations unfold.

Value conflicts in intercultural communication can also be illustrated using Schulz von Thun’s value and development quadrant. For example, imagine a person from Culture B, who places high importance on indirect communication, feeling attacked by a statement from someone in Culture A and accusing them of being rude or hurtful. The individual from Culture B perceives and interprets the value of ‘directness’ in Culture A, when taken to excess, as ‘communicative ruthlessness’.

The individual from Culture A may simply have wished to express their opinion openly and clearly. In some cases, however, this may – whether consciously or unconsciously – go too far and, according to Schulz von Thun, result in a ‘devaluing exaggeration’ of the original value, or at least be perceived as such, particularly when that value carries a different meaning in Culture B.

### Culture A 
**Value:** Directness  
**Devaluing exaggeration:** Brutal honesty  

### Culture B
**Value:** Indirectness  
**Devaluing exaggeration:** Vagueness

When intergenerational conflicts of the type described above arise, it may helpful if members of the cultures and generations involved recognise both the disparaging exaggerations they apply to one another and the related positive counter values. A solution is more likely if the parties concerned move towards appreciating the positive values of the other culture or generation. In this case, for example, members of a culture that favours direct communication might attempt to express themselves a little less bluntly – instead of saying ‘Bring me the report by 5 p.m. today,’ they might say ‘Could you bring me the report by 5 p.m. today?’

What has been outlined here only briefly as a possible solution is, of course, in reality a longer process of raising awareness and fostering an understanding of cultures and their values.
