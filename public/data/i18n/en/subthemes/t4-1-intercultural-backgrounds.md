places high importance on indirect communication, feeling attacked by a statement from 
someone in Culture A and accusing them of being rude or hurtful. The individual from Culture B perceives and interprets the value of ‘directness’ in Culture A, when take n to 
excess, as ‘communicative ruthlessness’.  
The individual from Culture A may simply have wished to express their opinion openly and clearly. In some cases, however, this may –  whether consciously or unconsciously –  go too 
far and, according to Schulz von Thun, result in a ‘ devaluing exaggeration ’ of the original 
value, or at least be perceived as such, particularly when that value carries a different meaning in Culture B.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
When intergenerational conflicts of the type described above arise, it may help ful if 
members of the cultures and generations involved recognise both the disparaging 
exaggerations they apply to one another and the  related  positive counter values . A solution 
is more likely if the parties concerned move towards appreciating the positive values of the other culture or generation. In this case, for example, members of a culture that favours 
direct communication might attempt to express themselves a lit tle less bluntly – instead of 
saying ‘Bring me the report by 5 p.m. today,’ they might say ‘Could you bring me the report 
by 5 p.m. today?’  
What has been outlined here only briefly as a possible solution is, of course, in reality a longer process of raising awareness and fostering an understanding of cultures and their values.  
Hierarchy  
Introduction  
When conflicts arise at work that are not only triggered by different generations but are also shaped by cultural background, hierarchy and power differences can play an important role.  
Hierarchy and power differences  are important for understanding generations and cultures 
because they strongly influence how people perceive authority, decision -making and social 
roles. These perceptions may differ not only between cultures but also between generations 
within the same c ulture.  Culture A  
Value: Directness  Culture B  
Value: Indirectness

What is hierarchy?  
What we refer to as hierarchy and power differences is defined by  Geert Hofstede as power 
distance . Hofstede understands power distance ( according to Geert Hofstede) as "the extent 
to which the less powerful members of organisations and institutions (such as the family) 
accept and expect that power is distributed unequally." https://geerthofstede.com/culture -
geert -hofstede -gert-jan-hofstede/6d- model -of-national- culture/  
It is therefore a matter of the extent to which societies regard hierarchies and power 
differences as normal and expected . Power distance may be expressed, for instance, 
through verbal and non -verbal communication habits, such as the use of polite forms and 
titles or gestures of respect like bowing and curtsying. It can also be observed in the way 
societies organise their so cial structures and processes, with top- down decision- making 
more common in those with higher power distance.  
Cultures with high power distance  (for example, many Asian, Arab or Latin American 
countries) accept clear hierarchies, expect top -down decisions and regard explicit rules of 
rank and respect for authority as self -evident. In these cultures, high power distance is 
viewed as natural and st abilising.  
By contrast, cultures with low power distance  (for example, Scandinavian countries, the 
Netherlands and Australia) favour flat hierarchies and prefer decision -making by consensus. 
Leaders are defined more by their role than by their hierarchical status, resulting in flatter structures and more equal treatment.  
The graphic below illustrates the power distance factor as defined by Hofstede, comparing 
how the partner countries involved in the MYCo project are positioned in relation to one 
another.

The survey conducted by the partnership in the participating countries indicates that 
hierarchy plays a role in intergenerational conflicts across all contexts. The German country report shows that participants were well aware of the differences between Ge rmany and 
countries such as Italy and Portugal, even among younger generations: ‘In some interactions 
with people from Mediterranean regions, hierarchical structures and attitudes are more pronounced. Younger people show more verbal respect towards older p eople when they 
come from these regions.’  
A cross -country comparison further reveals that, in all participating countries, younger 
generations are generally less supportive of hierarchical structures and favour flatter 
hierarchies and more egalitarian interactions. Older generations, by contrast, continue to 
expect authority, duty and hierarchical structures both of themselves and of others.  
 
How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the 
workplace when those involved come from cultures with different 
views on hierarchy ?

In a conflict of values concerning hierarchy, members of Culture A, who place importance on 
hierarchy, may accuse representatives of Culture B, who favour egalitarian structures, of 
being disoriented ( ‘You don’t know how to do that! Do it the way I tell you!’ ). Conversely, 
members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A, with their preference for 
hierarchical structures, of paternalism ( ‘Let me try it and see if it works!’ ). 
When such situations arise at work, it is important for those involved to recognise that 
neither the values of Culture A nor those of Culture B are inherently better or worse. What matters is developing an understanding of one another’s values.  
 
Results from the survey  
Reports from Germany and Poland indicate that younger generations are less comfortable with authoritarian leadership styles and top -down decision -making than their older 
counterparts. In these countries, conflicts often centre on adherence to hierarchical structures, respect and seniority –  particularly when young people come from strongly 
egalitarian cultures. One example from Germany noted: ‘We had a young intern from a 
different cultural background who struggled with the hierarchical structures of a prof essional 
kitchen. Some older team members were frustrated, but we eventually managed to resolve the issue.’  
In Italy and Portugal, which score more highly on the power distance index, the research 
examples appear to confirm that older people tend to favour controlling hierarchies and 
loyalty, while younger people seek greater autonomy and a stronger voice in dec ision -
making. Even here, however, a trend towards change is evident. It could also be argued that, 
despite this trend, tensions are heightened when older employees from Portugal and Italy 
work alongside younger employees from Germany or Poland, who prefer more egalitarian 
workplace structures.  
Nevertheless, the research suggests that misunderstandings and conflicts in the workplace, where cultural differences are a decisive factor, occur only occasionally. In most cases, participants expressed considerable openness towards other cultures.

Summary  
In summary, conflicts tend to arise when older employees in particular –  regardless of their 
country specific cultural background – demand hierarchy, status and respect for experience. 
Such demands may give rise to interpersonal tensions of varying intensity, depending on 
how closely or distantly colleagues from other cultures relate to these principles.  
 
Discussion questions 
Question 1: Imagine you are working in a multicultural, multigenerational team with colleagues from Germany, Poland, Italy and Portugal. Germany represents the least hierarchical culture and Portugal the most hierarchical. In what ways might cultural and 
generational differences show themselves in your workplace? Consider different scenarios 
involving Generation Z, Millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers.  
 
Question 2: How can organisations balance the older generations’ expectations of clear 
hierarchies and control with the younger generations’ preference for flat structures, shared 
decision -making and egalitarian cooperation –  particularly in multicultural teams? Suggest a 
few activities that could be introduced in your workplace to help prevent tension and 
misunderstandings.   
Uncertainty  avoidance  
Introduction  
When conflicts arise at work that are triggered not only by collaboration between different generations but also by cultural background, the concept of ‘ uncertainty avoidance ’, as 
defined by Geert Hofstede, may come into play.  
Uncertainty avoidance  is important for understanding generations and cultures in the 
workplace because it shapes how people perceive and respond to predictability, routine 
and structures that provide security . The degree of uncertainty avoidance required can vary 
both between cultures and between generations within the same culture. A clearer understanding of this factor can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and foster better cooperation in intercultural and intergenerational teams.  
 
What is uncertainty avoidance?  
According to Geert Hofstede, uncertainty  avoidance  refers to "a society's tolerance of 
uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty avoidance is not related to risk -taking or following 
rules. Rather, it has to do with fears and mistrust of the unknown and, conversely, with the 
desire for fixed habits and ritual s and the need to know the truth." 
https://geerthofstede.com/culture -geert -hofstede -gert-jan-hofstede/6d- model -of-national-
culture/  
The uncertainty avoidance factor describes the extent to which people in a society feel 
threatened by  unclear, unfamiliar or uncertain situations  – and the ways in which they seek 
to manage them through rules, structures or habits. It becomes evident in workplace

practices such as documenting and recording workflows and meetings. Cultures with high 
uncertainty avoidance generally favour greater structure and precision in these areas.  
Cultures with  high uncertainty avoidance  (for example, Germany, Greece, Portugal and 
Japan) prefer clear rules, detailed processes and predictability. Change is often stressful, as familiar procedures must be restructured, which in turn means that innovations are frequently introduced more slowl y. 
By contrast, cultures with  low uncertainty avoidance  (for example, the USA, Sweden and 
Singapore) are more receptive to new ideas and adapt more readily to changes in 
established processes. Rules are regarded more as guidelines than as strict requirements. 
Such cultures are generally characterised by a belief that people learn through action and practical experience, with mistakes viewed as opportunities for learning.

involved cultures . Irrespective of country -specific characteristics, older generations appear 
to value security more highly and to be less tolerant of ambiguity in the workplace. This was 
reflected in the German survey responses, which included comments such as: ‘Sometimes 
younger colleagues are more informal and more flexible with deadlines, while older 
generations are more structured. This can lead to tensions regarding project schedules and expectations.’  
While there seems to be recognition in all countries that uncertainty avoidance is experienced differently across generations, the same cannot be said for cultural variations in this factor. Our survey results suggest that uncertainty avoidance is not gene rally interpreted 
as culture -specific. This makes raising awareness of the issue all the more important.  
 
How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the 
workplace when those involved come from cultures with different 
levels of uncertainty avoidance?  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 In a value conflict involving uncertainty avoidance, members of Culture A, with high 
uncertainty avoidance, may accuse representatives of Culture B, with low uncertainty avoidance, of poor planning ( ‘You can’t just try that! We have to plan the test phase step by 
step first!’ ). Conversely, members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A of 
being overly controlling ( ‘No one needs minutes for the meeting! If there are any questions 
afterwards, everyone can check their own notes.’ ). 
When such situations occur in the workplace, it is important for those involved to recognise that neither the values of Culture A nor those of Culture B are inherently superior. What matters is developing an understanding of each other’s values.  
 
Results from the survey

One example of how this plays out in practice comes from Germany, where the survey 
clearly illustrates that a shift towards lower uncertainty avoidance is evident even in cultures that traditionally valued it highly. In terms of working style, younger employees place more 
emphasis on speed, efficiency and digital tools (e.g. AI, digital diagnostics), whereas older 
employees stress thoroughness, manual methods and practical experience. Conflicts arise when speed is prioritised over accuracy.  
A further example from Portugal supports this trend, revealing that the demand for precision – which requires more time and effort –  is giving way to a preference for speed and 
immediacy. There are reports of a drive for ‘immediacy’ and the pursuit of resu lts without 
fully considering the implications.  
Conflict is particularly likely when high uncertainty avoidance coincides with high power distance, which tends to reinforce status - or hierarchy -based thinking. In such cases, ‘playing 
it safe’ may also be interpreted as a way of maintaining power. Conversely, low uncertainty avoidance, combined with a strong willingness to embrace change among younger people, may be seen by older generations as a lack of respect for experience.  
 
Summary  
In summary, uncertainty avoidance appears to be an intergenerational factor, but it cannot be clearly identified as cultu re specific.  
 
Key Questions  
Question 1: Older generations tend to rely on established methods and tried- and-tested 
processes, whereas younger generations are more inclined to experiment, adopt new tools and prioritise quick results. How can teams strike a balance between the need for  proven 
methods and precision on the one hand, and innovation and pragmatism on the other? Reflect on your workplace and suggest three examples.  
 
Question 2: Many examples show that the use of different forms of communication in 
intergenerational collaboration –  for instance, messenger apps versus telephone calls, or 
brief messages versus detailed emails –  can lead to misunderstandings. Could the choice of 
comm unication medium also reflect higher or lower levels of uncertainty avoidance? Which 
channels make you feel most secure?  
Direct and indirect communication  
Introduction  
When conflicts arise at work that are triggered not only by intergenerational collaboration but also by cultural differences, Edward T. Hall’s concepts of ‘high- context’ and ‘low -context’ 
communication styles may become relevant. In this context, the terms  can be understood as 
‘indirect’ and ‘direct’ forms of communication.  
Considering communication styles is important for understanding generations and cultures in the workplace, as they shape how people interact with and perceive one another. The

degree of directness or indirectness preferred in communication may vary both between 
cultures and between generations within the same culture. A clearer understanding of these cultural and intergenerational factors can help prevent misunderstandings and c onflicts, and 
foster more effective cooperation in intercultural and intergenerational teams.  
 
Direct and indirect forms of communication  
Indirect communication ( high context according to Edward T. Hall) is a form of 
communication in which part of the message is not conveyed exclusively verbally, but also through the situational context –  e.g. through body language, facial expressions, tone of 
voice or through word choice that allows further interpretation of the  literal meaning . Much 
is understood "between the lines".  
Direct communication (low context according to Edward T. Hall) is a form of communication 
in which the message is expressed explicitly and directly in words. Meanings are to be 
understood literally, and double meanings or room for interpretation are rather rare.  
Indirect forms of communication are typically found in more traditional cultures with close social ties and a high level of shared knowledge, taking into account country -specific 
characteristics. Hall considers the following regions to be areas where indirect communication is used:  
 
Indirect communication  ( ‘high context’  by Edward T. Hall) is a style in which part of the 
message is conveyed not only through words but also through the surrounding non -verbal 
context – for example, body language, facial expressions, tone of voice or word choice  that 
invites interpretation beyond the literal meaning. Much is understood ‘between the lines’.  
Direct communication  ( ‘low context’  by Edward T. Hall) is a style in which the message is 
conveyed explicitly in words . Meanings are intended to be taken literally , with little room 
for ambiguity or double interpretation.  
Indirect forms of communication  are most often found in more traditional cultures with 
strong social ties and a high degree of shared knowledge, though the specifics vary from 
country to country. Hall identifies the following regions as relying on indirect communication:  
• East Asia: Japan, China, Korea  
• Arab countries  
• Latin America 
• Southern Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, Portugal)  
• Parts of Africa  
Direct forms of communication  are typically associated with cultures that have more 
individualistic lifestyles, frequently changing social groups and less shared background 
knowledge, although this varies between countries. Hall identifies the following regions as 
those where direct c ommunication is common:  
• Northern Europe: Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia

• North America: USA, Canada  
• Australia, New Zealand  
• Part of Great Britain  
The graph below illustrates Hall’s direct –indirect communication scale, showing how 
countries are ranked according to their degree of indirectness :

 Japan  
 Arab countries  
 China  
 India  
 Mediterranean countries: France, Italy, Spain  
 Great Britain  
 North America  
 Scandinavian countries  
 Germany  
Low context  
 
The survey conducted by the partnership in the participating countries shows that in all 
countries, the cultural factor of direct/indirect communication plays a role in intergenerational conflicts.  
Regardless of country -specific characteristics, all generations recognised that different 
communication styles can cause friction. Older generations in particular appear to prefer a 
more formal style, with greater emphasis on status and hierarchy. In high -context countries, 
this formal style is very likely to be accompanied by indirect patterns of communication.  
This was reflected in the project partnership survey, which included examples such as Millennials from Ireland reporting that their email tone was often misunderstood as 
aggressive. What was perhaps missing here was an element of indirect communication, 
which is frequently perceived as more polite.  
While participants acknowledged intergenerational differences in communication, the direct –indirect factor did not appear to be interpreted as culture -specific. This underlines the 
importance of raising awareness of the issue.

How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the 
workplace when those involved come from cultures with direct or 
indirect communication habits?  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When communication difficulties arise due to the directness or indirectness of a statement, 
members of Culture A, with a direct style, may accuse representatives of Culture B, with an 
indirect style, of being vague or unclear (‘Can’t you express yourself m ore clearly?!’). 
Conversely, members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A of being blunt (‘Can’t you say that a little more politely?!’).  
When such situations occur at work, it is important for those involved to recognise that neither communication style –  direct nor indirect – is inherently better or worse. What 
matters is developing an understanding of one another’s style.  
 
Results from the survey  
The project’s survey suggests that in Germany, Ireland and Poland, younger generations 
place greater emphasis on direct forms of communication, while older generations value 
more formal styles. A similar trend appears in Portugal and Italy, where older peo ple expect 
even greater respect in communication.  
In summary, culture -specific communication styles can often be a source of 
misunderstanding between generations at work. However, other cultural factors must also 
be considered. For example, silence –  whether perceived as a pause in verbal 
communication or as response time in written communication –  can be significant not only 
in relation to indirect communication but can also indicate the time needed to reflect on the CULTURE A – Direct 
communication  
- Clarity  
- Directness  CULTURE B – Indirect 
communication  
- Politeness  
- Indirectness

information received. A shorter or longer response time may therefore also be interpreted 
culturally through the lens of uncertainty avoidance: the longer the delay, the higher the level of uncertainty avoidance.  
 
Key questions  
Question 1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of direct communication across different media – for example, messenger apps, telephone calls and face -to-face 
conversations – when different generations and cultures work together?  
 
Question 2: What role does ‘showing respect’ play in communication between generations, 
and how do the different generations in your intercultural team express respect verbally?  
 
Key Takeaways  
• Misunderstandings – and sometimes conflicts –  between generations are often 
rooted in differences of values.  
• When addressing intergenerational misunderstandings and conflicts, it is important 
to take into account not only the values of different generations but also those of 
different cultures.  
• Each generation brings its own cultural values, which may vary from one country to 
another.  
• Younger generations (Generation Z, Millennials) across cultures tend to favour flatter hierarchies, greater pragmatism and more direct communication, while older generations (Generation X, Baby Boomers) are generally more conscious of hierarchy, 
place grea ter value on security, and adopt a more formal style.  
• A respectful exchange of values is beneficial in overcoming intergenerational and 
intercultural misunderstandings and conflicts.
