# Hierarchy

Hierarchy  
Introduction  
When conflicts arise at work that are not only triggered by different generations but are also shaped by cultural background, hierarchy and power differences can play an important role.  
Hierarchy and power differences  are important for understanding generations and cultures 
because they strongly influence how people perceive authority, decision -making and social 
roles. These perceptions may differ not only between cultures but also between generations 
within the same c ulture.  Culture A

What is hierarchy?  
What we refer to as hierarchy and power differences is defined by  Geert Hofstede as power 
distance . Hofstede understands power distance ( according to Geert Hofstede) as "the extent 
to which the less powerful members of organisations and institutions (such as the family) 
accept and expect that power is distributed unequally." https://geerthofstede.com/culture -

It is therefore a matter of the extent to which societies regard hierarchies and power 
differences as normal and expected . Power distance may be expressed, for instance, 
through verbal and non -verbal communication habits, such as the use of polite forms and 
titles or gestures of respect like bowing and curtsying. It can also be observed in the way 
societies organise their so cial structures and processes, with top- down decision- making 
more common in those with higher power distance.  
Cultures with high power distance  (for example, many Asian, Arab or Latin American 
countries) accept clear hierarchies, expect top -down decisions and regard explicit rules of 
rank and respect for authority as self -evident. In these cultures, high power distance is 
viewed as natural and st abilising.  
By contrast, cultures with low power distance  (for example, Scandinavian countries, the 
Netherlands and Australia) favour flat hierarchies and prefer decision -making by consensus. 
Leaders are defined more by their role than by their hierarchical status, resulting in flatter structures and more equal treatment.  
The graphic below illustrates the power distance factor as defined by Hofstede, comparing 
how the partner countries involved in the MYCo project are positioned in relation to one 
another.

The survey conducted by the partnership in the participating countries indicates that 
hierarchy plays a role in intergenerational conflicts across all contexts. The German country report shows that participants were well aware of the differences between Ge rmany and 
countries such as Italy and Portugal, even among younger generations: ‘In some interactions 
with people from Mediterranean regions, hierarchical structures and attitudes are more pronounced. Younger people show more verbal respect towards older p eople when they 
come from these regions.’  
A cross -country comparison further reveals that, in all participating countries, younger 
generations are generally less supportive of hierarchical structures and favour flatter 
hierarchies and more egalitarian interactions. Older generations, by contrast, continue to 
expect authority, duty and hierarchical structures both of themselves and of others.  
 
How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the 
workplace when those involved come from cultures with different 
views on hierarchy ?

In a conflict of values concerning hierarchy, members of Culture A, who place importance on 
hierarchy, may accuse representatives of Culture B, who favour egalitarian structures, of 
being disoriented ( ‘You don’t know how to do that! Do it the way I tell you!’ ). Conversely, 
members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A, with their preference for 
hierarchical structures, of paternalism ( ‘Let me try it and see if it works!’ ). 
When such situations arise at work, it is important for those involved to recognise that 
neither the values of Culture A nor those of Culture B are inherently better or worse. What matters is developing an understanding of one another’s values.  
 
Results from the survey  
Reports from Germany and Poland indicate that younger generations are less comfortable with authoritarian leadership styles and top -down decision -making than their older 
counterparts. In these countries, conflicts often centre on adherence to hierarchical structures, respect and seniority –  particularly when young people come from strongly 
egalitarian cultures. One example from Germany noted: ‘We had a young intern from a 
different cultural background who struggled with the hierarchical structures of a prof essional 
kitchen. Some older team members were frustrated, but we eventually managed to resolve the issue.’  
In Italy and Portugal, which score more highly on the power distance index, the research 
examples appear to confirm that older people tend to favour controlling hierarchies and 
loyalty, while younger people seek greater autonomy and a stronger voice in dec ision -
making. Even here, however, a trend towards change is evident. It could also be argued that, 
despite this trend, tensions are heightened when older employees from Portugal and Italy 
work alongside younger employees from Germany or Poland, who prefer more egalitarian 
workplace structures.  
Nevertheless, the research suggests that misunderstandings and conflicts in the workplace, where cultural differences are a decisive factor, occur only occasionally. In most cases, participants expressed considerable openness towards other cultures.

Summary  
In summary, conflicts tend to arise when older employees in particular –  regardless of their 
country specific cultural background – demand hierarchy, status and respect for experience. 
Such demands may give rise to interpersonal tensions of varying intensity, depending on 
how closely or distantly colleagues from other cultures relate to these principles.  
 
Discussion questions 
Question 1: Imagine you are working in a multicultural, multigenerational team with colleagues from Germany, Poland, Italy and Portugal. Germany represents the least hierarchical culture and Portugal the most hierarchical. In what ways might cultural and 
generational differences show themselves in your workplace? Consider different scenarios 
involving Generation Z, Millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers.  
 
Question 2: How can organisations balance the older generations’ expectations of clear 
hierarchies and control with the younger generations’ preference for flat structures, shared 
decision -making and egalitarian cooperation –  particularly in multicultural teams? Suggest a 
few activities that could be introduced in your workplace to help prevent tension and 
misunderstandings.   
Uncertainty  avoidance  
Introduction  
When conflicts arise at work that are triggered not only by collaboration between different generations but also by cultural background, the concept of ‘ uncertainty avoidance ’, as 
defined by Geert Hofstede, may come into play.
