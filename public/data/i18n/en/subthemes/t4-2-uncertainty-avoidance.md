# Uncertainty avoidance

## Introduction

When conflicts arise at work that are triggered not only by collaboration between different generations but also by cultural background, the concept of ‘uncertainty avoidance’, as defined by Geert Hofstede, may come into play.

Uncertainty avoidance is important for understanding generations and cultures in the workplace because it shapes how people perceive and respond to predictability, routine and structures that provide security. The degree of uncertainty avoidance required can vary both between cultures and between generations within the same culture. A clearer understanding of this factor can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and foster better cooperation in intercultural and intergenerational teams.

## What is uncertainty avoidance?

According to Geert Hofstede, uncertainty avoidance refers to "a society's tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty avoidance is not related to risk-taking or following rules. Rather, it has to do with fears and mistrust of the unknown and, conversely, with the desire for fixed habits and rituals and the need to know the truth."

The uncertainty avoidance factor describes the extent to which people in a society feel threatened by unclear, unfamiliar or uncertain situations – and the ways in which they seek to manage them through rules, structures or habits. It becomes evident in workplace practices such as documenting and recording workflows and meetings. Cultures with high uncertainty avoidance generally favour greater structure and precision in these areas.

Cultures with high uncertainty avoidance (for example, Germany, Greece, Portugal and Japan) prefer clear rules, detailed processes and predictability. Change is often stressful, as familiar procedures must be restructured, which in turn means that innovations are frequently introduced more slowly.

By contrast, cultures with low uncertainty avoidance (for example, the USA, Sweden and Singapore) are more receptive to new ideas and adapt more readily to changes in established processes. Rules are regarded more as guidelines than as strict requirements. Such cultures are generally characterised by a belief that people learn through action and practical experience, with mistakes viewed as opportunities for learning.

The graph below illustrates the uncertainty avoidance factor as defined by Hofstede, showing how the partner countries involved in the MYCo project rank in relation to one another.

The survey conducted by the partnership across the participating countries shows that the cultural factor of uncertainty avoidance plays a role in intergenerational conflicts in all involved cultures. Irrespective of country-specific characteristics, older generations appear to value security more highly and to be less tolerant of ambiguity in the workplace. This was reflected in the German survey responses, which included comments such as:  
> “Sometimes younger colleagues are more informal and more flexible with deadlines, while older generations are more structured. This can lead to tensions regarding project schedules and expectations.”

While there seems to be recognition in all countries that uncertainty avoidance is experienced differently across generations, the same cannot be said for cultural variations in this factor. Our survey results suggest that uncertainty avoidance is not generally interpreted as culture-specific. This makes raising awareness of the issue all the more important.

## How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the workplace when those involved come from cultures with different levels of uncertainty avoidance?

![Conflict Uncertainty Avoidance](/data/i18n/en/subthemes/images/t4-2-imageB.jpg)

**Culture A – High uncertainty avoidance**
- Planning  
- Regulation  
- Security  

**Culture B – Low uncertainty avoidance**
- Flexibility  
- Acceptance  
- Experimenting  

In a value conflict involving uncertainty avoidance, members of Culture A, with high uncertainty avoidance, may accuse representatives of Culture B, with low uncertainty avoidance, of poor planning (“You can’t just try that! We have to plan the test phase step by step first!”). Conversely, members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A of being overly controlling (“No one needs minutes for the meeting! If there are any questions afterwards, everyone can check their own notes.”).

When such situations occur in the workplace, it is important for those involved to recognise that neither the values of Culture A nor those of Culture B are inherently superior. What matters is developing an understanding of each other’s values.

## Results from the survey

Overall, younger generations in all countries participating in the survey appear to show greater tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity, regardless of whether their culture has a high or low tendency towards uncertainty avoidance.  

One example of how this plays out in practice comes from Germany, where the survey clearly illustrates that a shift towards lower uncertainty avoidance is evident even in cultures that traditionally valued it highly. In terms of working style, younger employees place more emphasis on speed, efficiency and digital tools (e.g. AI, digital diagnostics), whereas older employees stress thoroughness, manual methods and practical experience. Conflicts arise when speed is prioritised over accuracy.

A further example from Portugal supports this trend, revealing that the demand for precision – which requires more time and effort – is giving way to a preference for speed and immediacy. There are reports of a drive for ‘immediacy’ and the pursuit of results without fully considering the implications.

Conflict is particularly likely when high uncertainty avoidance coincides with high power distance, which tends to reinforce status- or hierarchy-based thinking. In such cases, “playing it safe” may also be interpreted as a way of maintaining power. Conversely, low uncertainty avoidance, combined with a strong willingness to embrace change among younger people, may be seen by older generations as a lack of respect for experience.

## Summary

In summary, uncertainty avoidance appears to be an intergenerational factor, but it cannot be clearly identified as culture specific.
