# Uncertainty avoidance

Uncertainty avoidance  is important for understanding generations and cultures in the 
workplace because it shapes how people perceive and respond to predictability, routine 
and structures that provide security . The degree of uncertainty avoidance required can vary 
both between cultures and between generations within the same culture. A clearer understanding of this factor can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and foster better cooperation in intercultural and intergenerational teams.  
 
What is uncertainty avoidance?  
According to Geert Hofstede, uncertainty  avoidance  refers to "a society's tolerance of 
uncertainty and ambiguity. Uncertainty avoidance is not related to risk -taking or following 
rules. Rather, it has to do with fears and mistrust of the unknown and, conversely, with the 
desire for fixed habits and ritual s and the need to know the truth."

The uncertainty avoidance factor describes the extent to which people in a society feel 
threatened by  unclear, unfamiliar or uncertain situations  – and the ways in which they seek 
to manage them through rules, structures or habits. It becomes evident in workplace

practices such as documenting and recording workflows and meetings. Cultures with high 
uncertainty avoidance generally favour greater structure and precision in these areas.  
Cultures with  high uncertainty avoidance  (for example, Germany, Greece, Portugal and 
Japan) prefer clear rules, detailed processes and predictability. Change is often stressful, as familiar procedures must be restructured, which in turn means that innovations are frequently introduced more slowl y. 
By contrast, cultures with  low uncertainty avoidance  (for example, the USA, Sweden and 
Singapore) are more receptive to new ideas and adapt more readily to changes in 
established processes. Rules are regarded more as guidelines than as strict requirements. 
Such cultures are generally characterised by a belief that people learn through action and practical experience, with mistakes viewed as opportunities for learning.

involved cultures . Irrespective of country -specific characteristics, older generations appear 
to value security more highly and to be less tolerant of ambiguity in the workplace. This was 
reflected in the German survey responses, which included comments such as: ‘Sometimes 
younger colleagues are more informal and more flexible with deadlines, while older 
generations are more structured. This can lead to tensions regarding project schedules and expectations.’  
While there seems to be recognition in all countries that uncertainty avoidance is experienced differently across generations, the same cannot be said for cultural variations in this factor. Our survey results suggest that uncertainty avoidance is not gene rally interpreted 
as culture -specific. This makes raising awareness of the issue all the more important.  
 
How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the 
workplace when those involved come from cultures with different 
levels of uncertainty avoidance?  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 In a value conflict involving uncertainty avoidance, members of Culture A, with high 
uncertainty avoidance, may accuse representatives of Culture B, with low uncertainty avoidance, of poor planning ( ‘You can’t just try that! We have to plan the test phase step by 
step first!’ ). Conversely, members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A of 
being overly controlling ( ‘No one needs minutes for the meeting! If there are any questions 
afterwards, everyone can check their own notes.’ ). 
When such situations occur in the workplace, it is important for those involved to recognise that neither the values of Culture A nor those of Culture B are inherently superior. What matters is developing an understanding of each other’s values.  
 
Results from the survey

One example of how this plays out in practice comes from Germany, where the survey 
clearly illustrates that a shift towards lower uncertainty avoidance is evident even in cultures that traditionally valued it highly. In terms of working style, younger employees place more 
emphasis on speed, efficiency and digital tools (e.g. AI, digital diagnostics), whereas older 
employees stress thoroughness, manual methods and practical experience. Conflicts arise when speed is prioritised over accuracy.  
A further example from Portugal supports this trend, revealing that the demand for precision – which requires more time and effort –  is giving way to a preference for speed and 
immediacy. There are reports of a drive for ‘immediacy’ and the pursuit of resu lts without 
fully considering the implications.  
Conflict is particularly likely when high uncertainty avoidance coincides with high power distance, which tends to reinforce status - or hierarchy -based thinking. In such cases, ‘playing 
it safe’ may also be interpreted as a way of maintaining power. Conversely, low uncertainty avoidance, combined with a strong willingness to embrace change among younger people, may be seen by older generations as a lack of respect for experience.  
 
Summary  
In summary, uncertainty avoidance appears to be an intergenerational factor, but it cannot be clearly identified as cultu re specific.  
 
Key Questions  
Question 1: Older generations tend to rely on established methods and tried- and-tested 
processes, whereas younger generations are more inclined to experiment, adopt new tools and prioritise quick results. How can teams strike a balance between the need for  proven 
methods and precision on the one hand, and innovation and pragmatism on the other? Reflect on your workplace and suggest three examples.  
 
Question 2: Many examples show that the use of different forms of communication in 
intergenerational collaboration –  for instance, messenger apps versus telephone calls, or 
brief messages versus detailed emails –  can lead to misunderstandings. Could the choice of 
comm unication medium also reflect higher or lower levels of uncertainty avoidance? Which 
channels make you feel most secure?
