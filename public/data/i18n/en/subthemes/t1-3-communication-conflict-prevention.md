# The Role of Open Dialogue and Social Interaction in Conflict Prevention in the Workplace

## Introduction

Our research results show that each generation rates itself as competent in various conflict prevention and management tools.  
The consensus across all generations was that **“A Culture of Open Dialogue”** is the most important factor in preventing conflict and in managing and addressing conflict when it does arise in the workplace.  
**Regular Social Interaction** was also highly rated as a tool for managing conflict in the workplace.  
All generations rated **“Formal Policies”** as being ineffective in the area of conflict management, reflecting a propensity to exhaust all other options before instigating formal procedures.  
Where respondents described being involved in conflict in the workplace they felt equally supported by colleagues of all generations.  

## Conflict Prevention Tools

Each participant in our survey rated the effectiveness of five different **Conflict Prevention and Management Strategies** for their generation and for all other generations.  
This facilitated a comparative analysis of **self-perception versus perception by others** for all four generations in the context of conflict management.

Survey results show that preferences for each of the tools below to be broadly similar across generations, with a **Culture of Open Dialogue** being the preferred strategy across all generations and **Formal Conflict Resolution Policies** to be the least preferred option.

The strategies and tools were rated 1 – 5 as below:

1. Culture of Open Dialogue  
2. Regular Social Interaction  
3. Regular Customised Feedback  
4. Intergenerational Teams  
5. Formal Conflict Resolution Policies  

Participants also related real life experience of involvement in conflict, either as an instigator or a mediator.  

## Self-Perception vs Perception by Others in Conflict Management

The results of our survey indicate that while members of a generation may believe that their strengths and weaknesses lie in one particular area of conflict management, this opinion is not necessarily held by co-workers of a different generation.

Gen Z and Millennials rated their effectiveness at conflict management significantly higher than the score attributed to them by all other generations, while Boomers scored themselves lower than the perception of them held by other generations.  
Gen Z’s self-perception was mostly in line with expectations of the other generations.  

### Gen Z

Gen Z rated **Open Dialogue**, **Regular Social Interaction** and **Customised Feedback** as being the most effective means of conflict prevention and management for their generation, while scoring Customised Feedback as moderately effective, intergenerational teams as somewhat useful and formal policies as the least effective.  
All other generations agreed that Open Dialogue and Social Interaction were the most effective means of conflict prevention for this generation.

Gen Z self-assessed their skills in **communication**, **empathy**, **problem solving** and **adaptability** much higher than the rating given to them by other generations, most notably in the area of **adaptability**.

### Millennials

Millennials rated the various conflict prevention and resolution tools in similar terms to Gen Z.  
**Open Dialogue**, **Regular Social Interaction** and **Customised Feedback** were considered the most effective means of conflict prevention and management for their generation, while Customised Feedback was rated as moderately effective, intergenerational teams as somewhat useful and formal policies as the least effective.

Gen Z perceived Millennials as especially effective at using Open Dialogue and Social Interaction to prevent conflict.  
**Baby Boomers** saw Millennials as more competent than them in Open Dialogue, Social Interaction and Feedback but less effective in participating in multi-generational teams and in the use of formal conflict resolution policies.

Millennials rated their overall conflict management skills at **7 out of 10**, while the consensus among other generations was that Millennials possessed **average skills** in this area (around 5 on the scale).

### Gen X

Gen X rated each conflict management tool in the same order of importance as Gen Z and Millennials, once again rating **A Culture of Open Dialogue** as most important and **Formal Policies** as least important.  
Aggregated results show that Gen X’s self-perception is in line with others’ perception.  
However, this masks a subtle difference where Gen Z and Millennials perceived Gen X as being slightly less effective in conflict management than themselves, while Boomers rated Gen X as being more competent than their own generation.

### Baby Boomers

Boomers rated each conflict management tool in the same order of importance as the other three generations.  
**A Culture of Open Dialogue** was rated as most important, with **Regular Social Interaction** and **Regular Customised Feedback** rated equally important, and **Formal Policies** as least important.  
Gen Z perceived Boomers as being less effective at working in **Intergenerational Teams** and in implementing **Formal Conflict Resolution Policies**.
