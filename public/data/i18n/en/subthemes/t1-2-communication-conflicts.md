Identity and Value based conflict in the workplace  
 
Introduction  
In order to pre -empt conflict , employers need to be aware of the issues most likely to cause 
conflict and the relevant strategies and tools to resolve conflict when it arises. The results of 
our survey show that workers across all generations were in broad agreement around the most fre quent causes of conflict in the workplace,  ranking potential sources of discord as  
below  
1. Identity based conflict  
2. Value Based Conflict  
3. Behaviour Based Conflict  
4. Organisational Culture  
 
 
Identity Based Confli cts 
As workplaces become more diverse in ethnicity, culture and age the risk of  identity and 
value -based  conflict increases. Our survey shows that these two factors are rated by each of 
the four generations as the most likely causes of disagreement in the workplace. Examples 
from our survey include : 
 
Cultural Identity Conflict  
In multicultural European workplaces, employees from minority backgrounds may experience alienation or exclusion due to differing cultural norms or communication styles. For instance, a worker from a minority ethnic group may struggle to connect with colle agues who share 
different cultural references, leading to feelings of isolation and reduced participation   
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Conflict  
Conflicts can arise when employees face intolerance or discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. In some European contexts, despite legal protections, LGBTQ+ employees may encounter microaggressions, exclusion from informal networks, or inappropriate jokes, creating a hostile work environment  
Generational Identity Conflict  
Workplaces with diverse age groups often experience tension due to differing values and work styles. For example, younger employees may prioritize flexibility and digital communication, while older colleagues may value traditional hierarchies and face -to-face 
interaction. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and reduced collaboration

Professional vs. Personal Identity Conflict  
Employees may feel pressured to conform to organizational norms that conflict with their 
personal values. For example, someone who values ethical transparency may feel conflicted working in a sales -driven culture that emphasizes aggressive tactics   
 
Value Based Conflicts  
Ethical disagreements  – For example, one employee may believe in strict adherence to rules, 
while another prioritizes flexibility or personal judgment, leading to conflict over decision -
making.  
Work -life balance vs. productivity  – A team member who values personal time may clash with 
a colleague who prioritizes long hours and constant availability.  
Diversity and inclusion perspectives  – Differences in views on cultural sensitivity, gender roles, 
or inclusion practices can lead to tension, especially if one person feels their values are being 
dismissed or undermined.  
Approach to leadership or teamwork  – Some employees may value hierarchical structures 
and clear authority, while others prefer collaborative or flat team dynamics.  
Environmental or social responsibility  – Conflicts may arise when employees disagree on the 
importance of sustainability or corporate social responsibility in business decisions.  
Innovation vs. tradition  – A younger employee may push for new technologies or methods, 
while a more experienced colleague may value established practices and caution.  
 
Research shows that open communication channels enable individuals to express concerns 
constructively and listen actively, which helps de -escalate the tensions described before they 
evolve into deeper conflicts . This correlates with our research outlined above where open 
dialogue was rated as the most important tool for conflict prevention  and management. 
Moreover, communication strategies such as active listening, feedback mechanisms, and 
mediation contribute to stronger interpersonal relationships and tea m cohesion, ultimately 
enhancing organizational performance . When organizations prioritize these tools and 
strategies as a cornerstone  of their conflict resolution framework, they not only mitigate 
identify and value - based clashes but also cultivate a more harmonious and productive work 
environment.  
 
Discussion Questions  
 
1. Is the implementation of a robust EDI policy the best way to prevent identity and 
value -based  conflict in the workplace?  
 
2. Is it a bad idea to “bring your whole self to work”?
