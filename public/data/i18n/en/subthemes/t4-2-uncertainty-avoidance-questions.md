# Reflection Questions

## Question 1

**Which of the following approaches would be most effective for an international and intergenerational project team that includes members from both high and low uncertainty-avoidance cultures?**

a) Establish very detailed procedures for every task and require strict adherence from all team members to ensure consistency across cultures.  
b) Allow each team member to decide independently how to complete tasks, without any shared guidelines, to encourage creativity and autonomy.  
c) Combine clear basic structures (such as documented goals and workflows) with room for flexibility in how tasks are carried out.  
d) Avoid discussing cultural preferences around structure and flexibility, since addressing them might increase tension within the team.  

✅ **Answer:** Combine clear basic structures (such as documented goals and workflows) with room for flexibility in how tasks are carried out.  
Recognising that team members from high uncertainty-avoidance cultures need clarity and predictability, while those from low uncertainty-avoidance cultures value flexibility and innovation shows appreciation of both, culture and generations. Balancing through structured flexibility supports effective collaboration and reduces cultural tension.

## Question 2

**How does the concept of uncertainty avoidance help explain the cultural differences reflected in the generational workplace trends described in the conducted research?**

a) Younger generations—shaped by globalisation and digitalisation—show attitudes closer to low uncertainty avoidance cultures, favouring flexibility, speed and experimentation.  
b) Cultural differences disappear when younger generations adopt new technologies, since uncertainty avoidance no longer plays a role.  
c) High uncertainty avoidance always leads to hierarchical workplaces, regardless of cultural or generational context.  
d) Differences in working styles are mainly due to individual personality traits, not to cultural backgrounds.  

✅ **Answer:** Younger generations—shaped by globalisation and digitalisation—show attitudes closer to low uncertainty avoidance cultures, favouring flexibility, speed and experimentation.  
National culture and generational change interact in a way that even in high uncertainty-avoidance cultures, younger generations are moving toward values typical of low uncertainty-avoidance societies, influencing how work is organised and how conflict arises.

## Question 3

**Older generations tend to rely on established methods and tried-and-tested processes, whereas younger generations are more inclined to experiment, adopt new tools and prioritise quick results. How can teams strike a balance between the need for proven methods and precision on the one hand, and innovation and pragmatism on the other? Reflect on your workplace and suggest three examples.**

## Question 4

**Many examples show that the use of different forms of communication in intergenerational collaboration – for instance, messenger apps versus telephone calls, or brief messages versus detailed emails – can lead to misunderstandings. Could the choice of communication medium also reflect higher or lower levels of uncertainty avoidance? Which channels make you feel most secure?**
