# Direct and indirect communication

## Introduction

When conflicts arise at work that are triggered not only by intergenerational collaboration but also by cultural differences, Edward T. Hall’s concepts of ‘high-context’ and ‘low-context’ communication styles may become relevant. In this context, the terms can be understood as ‘indirect’ and ‘direct’ forms of communication.

Considering communication styles is important for understanding generations and cultures in the workplace, as they shape how people interact with and perceive one another. The degree of directness or indirectness preferred in communication may vary both between cultures and between generations within the same culture. A clearer understanding of these cultural and intergenerational factors can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and foster more effective cooperation in intercultural and intergenerational teams.

## Direct and indirect forms of communication

Indirect communication (‘high context’ according to Edward T. Hall) is a style in which part of the message is conveyed not only through words but also through the surrounding non-verbal context – for example, body language, facial expressions, tone of voice or word choice that invites interpretation beyond the literal meaning. Much is understood ‘between the lines’.

Direct communication (‘low context’ according to Edward T. Hall) is a style in which the message is conveyed explicitly in words. Meanings are intended to be taken literally, with little room for ambiguity or double interpretation.

Indirect forms of communication are most often found in more traditional cultures with strong social ties and a high degree of shared knowledge, though the specifics vary from country to country. Hall identifies the following regions as relying on indirect communication:

- East Asia: Japan, China, Korea  
- Arab countries  
- Latin America  
- Southern Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, Portugal)  
- Parts of Africa  

Direct forms of communication are typically associated with cultures that have more individualistic lifestyles, frequently changing social groups and less shared background knowledge, although this varies between countries. Hall identifies the following regions as those where direct communication is common:

- Northern Europe: Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia  
- North America: USA, Canada  
- Australia, New Zealand  
- Part of Great Britain  

The graph below illustrates Hall’s direct–indirect communication scale, showing how countries are ranked according to their degree of indirectness:

The survey conducted by the partnership in the participating countries shows that in all countries, the cultural factor of direct/indirect communication plays a role in intergenerational conflicts.

Regardless of country-specific characteristics, all generations recognised that different communication styles can cause friction. Older generations in particular appear to prefer a more formal style, with greater emphasis on status and hierarchy. In high-context countries, this formal style is very likely to be accompanied by indirect patterns of communication.

This was reflected in the project partnership survey, which included examples such as Millennials from Ireland reporting that their email tone was often misunderstood as aggressive. What was perhaps missing here was an element of indirect communication, which is frequently perceived as more polite.

While participants acknowledged intergenerational differences in communication, the direct–indirect factor did not appear to be interpreted as culture-specific. This underlines the importance of raising awareness of the issue.

## How do intergenerational conflicts manifest themselves in the workplace when those involved come from cultures with direct or indirect communication habits?

**Culture A – Direct communication**
- Clarity  
- Directness  

**Culture B – Indirect communication**
- Politeness  
- Indirectness  

When communication difficulties arise due to the directness or indirectness of a statement, members of Culture A, with a direct style, may accuse representatives of Culture B, with an indirect style, of being vague or unclear (“Can’t you express yourself more clearly?!”). Conversely, members of Culture B may accuse representatives of Culture A of being blunt (“Can’t you say that a little more politely?!”).

When such situations occur at work, it is important for those involved to recognise that neither communication style – direct nor indirect – is inherently better or worse. What matters is developing an understanding of one another’s style.

## Results from the survey

The project’s survey suggests that in Germany, Ireland and Poland, younger generations place greater emphasis on direct forms of communication, while older generations value more formal styles. A similar trend appears in Portugal and Italy, where older people expect even greater respect in communication.

In summary, culture-specific communication styles can often be a source of misunderstanding between generations at work. However, other cultural factors must also be considered. For example, silence – whether perceived as a pause in verbal communication or as response time in written communication – can be significant not only in relation to indirect communication but can also indicate the time needed to reflect on the information received. A shorter or longer response time may therefore also be interpreted culturally through the lens of uncertainty avoidance: the longer the delay, the higher the level of uncertainty avoidance.
