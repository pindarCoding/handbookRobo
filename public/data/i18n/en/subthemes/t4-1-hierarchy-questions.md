b) Offer intergenerational dialogue workshops where employees from different cultures and age groups can discuss their expectations around hierarchy, authority, and cooperation.  
c) Allow each cultural group to follow its own preferred hierarchy model.  
d) Avoid addressing hierarchy directly, as such discussions might make older employees uncomfortable and increase conflict.
