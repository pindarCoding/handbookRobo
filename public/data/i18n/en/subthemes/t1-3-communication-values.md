The Role of Open Dialogue and Social Interaction in 
Conflict Prevention in the Workplace  
 
Introduction  
Our research results  show that each generation rates itself as competent in various conflict 
prevention and management tools. The consensus across all generations was that “A Culture 
of Open Dialogue” is the most important factor in preventing conflict and in managing and 
addressing conflict when it does arise in the workplace. Regular Social Interaction was also 
highly rated as a tool for managing conflict in the workplace. All generations rated “Formal Policies” as being ineffective in the area of conflic t management,  reflecting a propensity to 
exhaust all other options before instigating formal procedures. Where respondents described being involved in conflict in the workplace they felt equally supported by colleagues of all generations.  
 
 
Conflict Prevention Tools  
Each participant in our survey rated the effectiveness of five different Conflict Prevention and 
Management Strategies for their generation and for all other generations. This facilitated a 
comparative analysis of self -perception versus perception by other s for all four generations in 
the context of conflict management.  
Survey results show that preferences for each of the tools below to be broadly similar across 
generations, with a Culture of Open Dialogue being the preferred strategy across all generations and Formal Conflict Resolution Policies to be the least preferred  option. The 
strategies and tools were rated 1 –  5 as below  
 
1. Culture of Open Dialogue  
2. Regular Social Interaction  
3. Regular Customised Feedback  
4. Intergenerational Teams  
5. Formal Conflict Resolution Policies  
Participants also related real life experience of involvement in conflict, either as an instigator or a mediator.  
 
Self-Perception v Perception by others in Conflict Management  
 
The results of our survey indicate that while members of a generation may believe that their 
strengths and weaknesses lie in one particular area of conflict management this opinion is not 
necessarily held by co- workers of a different generation.

Gen Z and Millennials rated their effectiveness at conflict management significantly higher 
than the score attributed to them by all other generations while Boomers scored themselves lower than the perception of them held by other generations. Gen Z’s self- perception was 
mostly in line with expectations of the other generations.  
 
Gen Z  
Gen Z rated Open Dialogue, Regular Social Interaction and Customised Feedback as being the 
most effective means of conflict prevention and management for their generation while 
scoring Customised Feedback as moderately effective, intergenerational teams as  somewhat 
useful and formal policies as the least effective. All other generations agreed that Open Dialogue and Social Interaction were most effective means of conflict prevention for this 
generation.  
Gen Z self -assessed their skills in communication, empathy, problem solving and adaptability 
much higher than the rating given to them by other generations, most notably in the area of 
adaptability.  
 
 
 
 
 
Millennials  
Millennials rated the various conflict prevention and resolution tools in similar terms to Gen Z. 
Open Dialogue, Regular Social Interaction and Customised Feedback were considered the 
most effective means of conflict prevention and management for their gen eration while 
Customised Feedback was rated as moderately effective, intergenerational teams as 
somewhat useful and formal policies as the least effective.  
Gen Z perceived Millennials as especially effective at using Open Dialogue and Social Interaction to prevent conflict. Baby boomers saw Millennials as more competent than them

in Open Dialogue, Social Interaction and Feedback but less effective in participating in multi - 
generational teams and in the use of formal conflict resolution policies.  
Millennials rated their overall conflict management skills at 7 out of 10, while the consensus 
among other generations was that millennials possessed average skills in this area at point 5 on the scale.  
 
 
 
 
Gen X  
Gen x rated each conflict management tool in the same order of importance as Gen z and 
Millennials, once again rating A Culture of Open Dialogue as most important and formal 
policies as least important.  Aggregated results show that Gen X’s self- perception  is in line 
with others perception. However, this masks a subtle difference where Gen Z and Millennials 
perceived Gen X as being slightly less effective in conflict management than themselves while Boomers rated Gen x as being more competent than their own  generation.

Boomers  
Boomers rated each conflict management tool in the same order of importance as the other 
three generations.  A Culture of Open Dialogue was rated as most important with Regular 
Social Interaction and Regular Customised Feedback rated equally important and formal policies as least important.  Gen Z perceived Boomers as being less effective at working in Intergenerational Teams and in implementing Formal Conflict Resolution Policies.  
 
 
 
Discussion Questions  
 
1. How do managers know that they have create d and nurture d a Culture of Open 
Dialogue in the workplace?   
 
2. How do  employers and managers create opportunities for social interaction within 
and outside the workplace  in organisations where remote working is the norm?

Key takeaways  
 
Effective communication is a cornerstone of conflict prevention and resolution. Clear, 
respectful, and timely communication fosters mutual understanding, reduces misinterpretations, and promotes a culture of transparency and trust among employees . 
Managing intergenerational workplace conflict  involves  
• providing clarity about appropriate communication channel s 
• agreeing appropriate response times  
• identifying sources of conflict particularly identity and value -based conflict  
• promoting open dialogue  as a means of conflict prevention  
 
Generational differences in preferred communication methods —such as Gen Z’s reliance on 
instant messaging versus Boomers’ preference for face -to-face interaction —can lead to 
misunderstandings , impact negatively on team dynamics  and create operational 
inefficiencies.  
Conflict  stemming from cultural, generational, and ethical differences, are common in diverse 
teams and require proactive strategies to address. Across all generations, open dialogue and regular social interaction emerged as the most effective tools for conflict pr evention, while 
formal policies were seen as less impactful. The research underscores the importance of 
fostering inclusive direct and indirect communication practices, encouraging mentorship 
across age groups, and  promoting open dialogue.
