## Question 1

**Which of the following best illustrates skills inequality in the workplace?**

a) Employees in rural areas struggle with unreliable internet connections during virtual meetings.  
b) Some workers use digital tools only for basic tasks while others use them for innovation.  
c) Younger employees quickly adapt to new collaboration software, while older employees require additional training.  
d) A company’s hierarchical culture discourages staff from experimenting with new digital tools.  

✅ **Answer:** Younger employees quickly adapt to new collaboration software, while older employees require additional training.  
Skills inequality refers to disparities in employees’ ability and confidence to use digital tools effectively. It often arises from generational differences or unequal access to digital education and training. While access and usage inequalities relate to technology availability and application, skills inequality focuses on the proficiency gap among employees.

## Question 2

**What is one major consequence of unaddressed digital inequality for organizations?**

a) Increased participation in intergenerational mentorship programs.  
b) Reduced productivity and innovation due to unequal digital skills and access.  
c) Improved employee retention and satisfaction.  
d) Greater consistency in communication styles across generations.  

✅ **Answer:** Reduced productivity and innovation due to unequal digital skills and access.  
When digital inequality is not addressed, organizations face reduced productivity, innovation stagnation, and higher turnover rates. Employees lacking tools or digital skills struggle to perform efficiently, which can hinder collaboration, creativity, and overall organizational performance.
