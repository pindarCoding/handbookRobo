# Work Styles and Collaboration

## Introduction

Beyond individual values and motivations, employees’ preferred working style — including their organizational preferences, collaborative methods, and communication habits — differ across generations. This encompasses aspects such as the style of feedback they prefer, their attitudes toward hierarchical versus flat organizational structures, their technology usage, views on remote or hybrid work arrangements, and their inclination for rapid decision-making versus thoughtful consideration.

Work styles influence the way individuals communicate, address challenges, and engage with their co-workers. They determine preferences for structured hierarchies or flat teams, formal dialogue or casual conversations, and individual tasks or group collaboration. Since work styles are profoundly affected by cultural and generational backgrounds, teams composed of multiple generations often face friction when their expectations diverge. Nevertheless, when these differences are acknowledged as complementary strengths, they can serve as a significant source of innovation and resilience.

### Baby Boomers

Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, typically favour well-defined structures, formal communication, and authoritative leadership. Their early experiences in conventional workplaces lead them to equate professionalism with authority, respect for experience, and direct interactions. For Boomers, effective collaboration occurs when roles and responsibilities are explicitly outlined, decisions are made through established processes, and authority is recognized. Although they have adjusted to digital tools, many still prefer face-to-face meetings for crucial discussions, viewing them as vital for fostering trust and accountability. Boomers may feel uneasy when digital platforms dominate communication without sufficient direction or assistance, and they might perceive a casual tone or quick responses as unprofessional. However, they bring discipline, consistency, and institutional knowledge to collaborative efforts, often offering stability during periods of change.

### Generation X

Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, experienced a shift from traditional to more adaptable workplace environments. Consequently, they are generally comfortable in both structured and autonomous situations. Gen X values independence and self-sufficiency but is also realistic enough to operate within established hierarchies when needed. They prefer collaboration that honours their autonomy, valuing clarity and fairness over excessive oversight. While Boomers may opt for lengthy, formal meetings, Gen X is inclined toward efficiency, finding a balance between collaboration and the capacity to work solo. Having come of age during the digital transformation, they are adept at handling both analogue and digital communication. In multigenerational teams, Gen X often acts as a mediator, bridging the formal approach of Boomers and the casual style of younger colleagues, while also contributing realistic and balanced viewpoints.

### Millennials

Individuals in the Millennial generation, born from 1981 to 1996, prioritize collaboration as an essential aspect of their work approach. They grew up in educational systems and workplaces that highlighted teamwork, inclusiveness, and ongoing feedback. Millennials appreciate open communication, flexible work settings, and team arrangements where contribution is valued over hierarchy. For them, collaboration thrives when leadership is supportive, communication is clear, and feedback is regularly provided. They adapt well to digital-first environments and often advocate for the use of collaborative platforms, virtual tools, and hybrid meeting options. Although they favour flatter organizational structures, they still seek clear guidance and coaching. Millennials may feel frustrated in rigid settings that limit participation or hinder innovation, but they excel in inclusive teams where all voices are acknowledged. Their collaborative style tends to promote creativity and strengthen team unity, although their need for constant feedback might be misinterpreted by older colleagues as craving validation or impatience.

### Generation Z

Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, approaches collaboration with influences from their digital adeptness and the uncertainty of the global landscape. Commonly seen as preferring solely digital communication, research indicates that Gen Z still values face-to-face interactions, particularly for mentorship and receiving feedback. They are at ease with instant messaging, video conferencing, and collaborative tools, perceiving these as standard rather than intrusive. For Gen Z, effective collaboration hinges on transparency, inclusiveness, and technological integration. They anticipate clear expectations and role definitions but show less tolerance for rigid hierarchies that hinder openness. Many of them prefer collegial, team-focused structures where contributions are swiftly acknowledged and feedback is prompt. However, they may feel disengaged if collaboration relies excessively on outdated technologies or if communication lacks consistency. Their adaptability and appreciation for diversity enable them to be valuable members of collaborative settings, yet they thrive best in organizations that combine digital skills with personal mentorship.

## Misunderstandings Across Work Styles

Misunderstandings frequently occur when these distinct work styles intersect.  
A Baby Boomer might perceive Gen Z’s preference for instant messaging as overly casual or unprofessional, while Gen Z may view an email-dominant approach as inefficient or antiquated.  
The Millennials’ call for frequent feedback might come across as excessive to managers who are used to traditional, formal performance assessments.  
Gen X may feel exasperated with structured check-ins they deem unnecessary, whereas younger colleagues might find Gen X's inclination for independence to be isolating or lacking in communication.  
Such clashes can hinder decision-making, erode trust, or foster stereotypes that undermine collaboration.

## Building Stronger Multigenerational Teams

Despite these hurdles, successful cross-generational collaboration is achievable and often yields outstanding results. Organizations that encourage open discussions about communication styles and create hybrid frameworks that balance flexibility with consistency are more likely to effectively navigate these differences.  

The COVID-19 pandemic hastened the shift towards remote and hybrid work models, revealing generational variances in preferences while also showing that all groups can adapt. For many Boomers and Gen X, remote work necessitated a shift toward less personal interaction, while Millennials and Gen Z found it to be a natural transition. The crucial factor for leaders is to acknowledge that each generation offers distinct advantages: Boomers provide experience and stability, Gen X brings independence and practicality, Millennials contribute collaboration and inclusivity, and Gen Z injects digital fluency and innovative ideas.

One particularly effective approach is reverse mentoring, where younger team members impart digital skills to older employees while receiving support and career insights in return. This not only enhances skillsets but also promotes mutual respect, challenging stereotypes on both sides. Leaders are essential in facilitating effective collaboration across generations by fostering psychological safety, defining roles, and encouraging inclusive communication practices. When leaders create environments that incorporate digital tools while also appreciating traditional interaction methods, teams can benefit from the strengths of both approaches.  

Ultimately, collaboration thrives when respect takes precedence over stereotypes. Generational differences should be viewed as complementary strengths rather than obstacles. The structured approach of Boomers offers stability, Gen X’s practical mindset provides balance, Millennials’ spirit of collaboration encourages inclusion, and Gen Z’s comfort with technology boosts innovation. By thoughtfully integrating these various approaches, organizations can build teams that are not only multigenerational but also multi-strength, where diverse working styles contribute to creativity and resilience instead of conflict.
